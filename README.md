# INPlandtest1

A simple LINE bot experiment for building goal maps.

## How to chat

Simply send a message to start a session. The bot will ask about your goal, any
other tasks you must handle, and how much time you can dedicate. Mention things
like *拆解* or *情緒* naturally in the conversation and the relevant features will
trigger automatically. If you ever want to reset the planning flow you can still
send `INPland`, but it is no longer required.
