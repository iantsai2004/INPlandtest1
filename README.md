# INPlandtest1

A simple LINE bot experiment for building goal maps.

## How to chat

* Start a new conversation by sending `INPland` as the first word. This clears the previous goal map and begins a fresh one.
* After starting, continue chatting normally without the prefix. The bot will guide you through providing your goal, other tasks you must handle, and the weekly time you can dedicate.
* You may send `INPland` again at any time to create another goal map.
