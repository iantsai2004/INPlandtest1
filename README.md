# INPlandtest1

A simple LINE bot experiment for building goal maps.

## How to chat

Simply send a message to start a session. The bot will ask about your goal,
any other tasks you must handle, and how much time you can dedicate. Every
message is forwarded to OpenAI so the conversation flows naturally without
needing special keywords. If you ever want to reset the planning flow you can
still send `INPland`, but it is no longer required.
